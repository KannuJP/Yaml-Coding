# Ansible/YAML Coding Standards

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

You are encouraged to add the dotfiles from this repository to your project, and use an editor/IDE which understands them â€” otherwise, know how to apply these rules to your files manually.

## Elements of a good playbook

* YAML documents (including Ansible playbooks) MUST begin a document with `---` followed by one empty line.

  ```yaml
  ---
  
  # Begin playbook...
  ```

* Every task MUST have a `name`.

* Every task MUST have 1 or more appropriate tags, annotated as an array instead of a single string.

  ```yaml
  # Good
  tags:
    - abc

  # Bad
  tags: abc
  ```

* You SHOULD use the built-in Ansible task (when available) instead of simply calling-out to the shell. See [Ansible: List of all modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_all_modules.html) for more information. In certain cases, Ansible actions are not yet powerful enough to replace Bash actions.

* Any use of `when` SHOULD happen _after_ the primary action (e.g., "do this thing _when_ this condition is met").

* Binary decisions MUST use `yes`/`no` instead of `true`/`false`.

## Editor Settings

* Indentation should be 2 spaces. Further, arrays (i.e., lines which begin with `-`) should be indented 2 spaces from its parent as well.

* Line-endings MUST use the `\n` character (`LF`) used by default on Mac OS X and *nix systems.

* Lines MUST NOT have trailing whitespace.

* A file MUST end with a single empty line feed.

* Files MUST use only UTF-8 _without_ BOM as its character encoding.

## Whitespace

* Files SHOULD have soft-limit of `80` characters per line. Valid exceptions are when you have an unbreaking line.

* Files SHOULD use long-form YAML, not short-form YAML.

  ```yaml
  # Good
  - name: Make new symlink
    file:
      state: link
      owner: root
      group: root
      src: /usr/local/okapi/{{ version }}
      path: /usr/local/okapi/okapi_new

  # Bad
  - name: Make new symlink
    file: state=link owner=root group=root src=/usr/local/okapi/{{ version }} path=/usr/local/okapi/okapi_new
  ```

## Comments

* Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged. A general rule of thumb is that if you look at a section of code and think "Wow, I don't want to try and describe that", you need to comment it before you forget how it works.

* For readability, comments MUST have a single space after `#`.

  ```yaml
  # Good Comment
  
  #Bad Comment
  #    Bad Comment
  #  Bad Comment
  ```

* There SHOULD always be one line of whitespace above the start of a comment block.

  ```yaml
  # This is my code.
  key: ansible_command
  
  # This is more code.
  key: another_ansible_command
  ```

* For inline comments (e.g., commenting-out a line), the comment MUST begin after the appropriate indentation, prefixing the line with a `# ` (hash-space). You MUST NOT add a `#` to the beginning of a line, being irrespective of indentation.

  ```yaml
  # Good
  abc:
    def:
      # - 123
      - 456
      - 789

  # Bad
  abc:
    def:
  #    - 123
      - 456
      - 789
  ```

## Spelling

If there is ever a discrepancy between English-speaking dialects, use **U.S. English** as a baseline for both spelling and word choice. [Grammarist](http://grammarist.com/spelling/) and similar websites can help ensure intended usage.

```
color (correct)
colour (incorrect)

spelled (correct)

canceled (correct)
cancelled (incorrect)

labeled (correct)

math (correct)

apartment (correct)
flat (incorrect)

"Apple is very successful." (correct)
